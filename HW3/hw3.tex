\begin{enumerate}
	
\item[1.]

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $L$ refer to the left-wing candidate and $R$ refer to the right-wing candidate. Simply as a matter of their positions, $L$ will always receive the $\frac{1}{4}$ to their left, and $R$ will always receive the $\frac{1}{8}$ to their right. However, given a uniform distribution we only have to figure out $\hat{x}$, the location of the voter that is indifferent between the candidates, to determine the share each candidate receives.

	Given the general utility function $v_i = r_i - T | x-l_i |$, utilities for a voter for $L$ and $R$ can be determined to equal $v_L = r_1 - T(x - \frac{1}{4})$ and $v_R = r_2 - T(\frac{7}{8} - x)$ respectively. Now we simply solve for x when $v_L = v_R$:
	
	\begin{align*}
		v_L &= v_R \\
		r_1 - T(\hat{x} - \frac{1}{4}) &= r_2 - T(\frac{7}{8} - \hat{x}) \\
		2T(\hat{x}) &= r_1 - r_2 + \frac{9}{8}T \\
		\hat{x} &= \frac{r_1 - r_2}{2T} + \frac{9}{16}
	\end{align*}
	
	Therefore, $L$ will receive $\hat{x}$ of the vote, and $R$ will receive $1 - \hat{x}$ of the vote.
	
	{\color{red} Note: I have numbers written for some reason? Don't think it's possible to have simple numbers}

	\item Very similar process to before, simply change the function slightly.
	
	\begin{align*}
		r_1 - T(\hat{x} - \frac{1}{4})^2 &= r_2 - T(\frac{7}{8} - \hat{x})^2 \\
		&tl;dr \\
		\hat{x} &= \frac{4}{5}(\frac{r_1-r_2}{T}) + \frac{9}{16} \\
	\end{align*}

	{\color{red} TODO: derive pls}

	\item Once again, we know that at the very least, $L$ will always receive the voters spanning the $\frac{1}{4}$ to their left, and $R$ will always receive the voters spannihg the $\frac{1}{8}$ to their right. Given the changed distribution, we know that they will each receive $\frac{1}{8}$ of the votes at least.
	
	To determine the rest, we first need the location of the indifferent voter $\hat{x}$, which we already calculated for this equation to be $\frac{r_1 - r_2}{2T} + \frac{9}{16}$. From this, we can then calculate how many votes from the "middle" each candidate gets (represented by $M_L$ and $M_R$ respectively) by multiplying the "distance" to the indifferent voter by the amount of voters between the candidates:

	\begin{multicols}{2}
		\noindent
		\begin{align*}
			M_L &= \frac{\hat{x} - \frac{1}{4}}{\frac{7}{8} - \frac{1}{4}} * \frac{3}{4} \\
			&tl;dr \\
			\hat{x} &= \frac{3}{5} * \frac{r_1 - r_2}{T} + \frac{1}{2}
		\end{align*}
		\begin{align*}
			M_R = \frac{\frac{7}{8} - \hat{x}}{\frac{7}{8} - \frac{1}{4}} * \frac{3}{4}
		\end{align*}		
	\end{multicols}

	{\color{red} derive pls}

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
