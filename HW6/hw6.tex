\begin{enumerate}
	
\item[1.] 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Firms on the competitive fringe are price-takers, so they take $P$ as given and produce a quantity where $MC=P$. In this case, $P = MC = 10 + 50q_i$, so an individual fringe firm will produce $q_i = \frac{1}{50}P - \frac{1}{10}$. Since there are 100 firms, the total supply for the competitive fringe $Q_f = 100 q_i = 2P - 20$. Note that this only holds if $P>10$, as otherwise this model implies that firms would produce a negative quantity (when in reality they would shut down and produce nothing).
	
	{\color{blue}\textbf{Solution:} The supply curve for the competitive fringe is $Q_f = 2P-20$ where $P > 10$, otherwise 0.}
	\item To solve for residual demand, all we need to do is take market demand $Q_m = 400 - 8P$ and subtract $Q_f$ from it. Since the residual demand is the demand for the dominant firm, we will call it $Q_d = 400 - 8P - (2P - 20) = 420 - 10P$.
	{\color{blue}\textbf{Solution:} Residual demand faced by the dominant firm is $Q_d = 420 - 10P$}
	\item Given the residual demand, we can simply solve this like any other monopolist problem, where the objective is to maximize the dominant firm's profit $\pi_d$ by setting price:
	\begin{align*}
		max p \pi_d &= (420-10P)(P -10) \\
		\frac{\partial\pi}{\partial p} &= (420-10P) + (-10)(P - 10) \\
		0 &= 420-10P-10P+100 \\
		P &= 520 / 20 = 26
	\end{align*}
	Now that we know $P$, we can solve for everything else quite trivially; $Q_d = 420 - 10(26) = 160, Q_f = 2(26) - 20 = 32$, and the market shares for the dominant firm and the fringe are $\frac{160}{160 + 32} = \frac{5}{6}$ and $\frac{1}{6}$ respectively.

	{\color{blue}\textbf{Solution:} $P = 26, Q_d = 160, Q_f = 32$, and market shares for dominant firm and fringe are $\frac{5}{6}$ and $\frac{1}{6}$ respectively.}
	\item Recall that $Q_d = 420 - 10P$, or equivalently, $P = 42 - \frac{1}{10}Q$. Considering that now $Q$ is equal to $q_1 + q_2$ (the combined total that firms 1 and 2 produce), we can solve for both firms' profit-maximizing quantity via symmetry:
	\begin{align*}
		max_{q_1} \pi_1 &= (P - c)(q_1) \\
		&= (42 - \frac{1}{10}q_1 - \frac{1}{10}q_2 - 10)(q_1) \\
		\frac{\partial \pi_1}{\partial q_1} &= 32 - \frac{2}{10}q_1 - \frac{1}{10}q_2 = 0 \\
		q_1 &= \frac{10}{2} (32 - \frac{1}{10}q_2) \\
		&= 160 - \frac{1}{2}q_2 \\
		\therefore q_2 &= 160 - \frac{1}{2}q_1 \\
		\therefore q_1 &= 160 - \frac{1}{2}(160 - \frac{1}{2}q_1) \\
		&= 80 + \frac{1}{4}q_1 \\
		q_1 = q_2 &= \frac{4}{3} *80 = \frac{320}{3} \\
		\therefore Q_d &= \frac{640}{3} \approx 213.33
	\end{align*}

	Plugging into the inverse residual demand function, we get $P = 42 - \frac{1}{10} * \frac{640}{3} = \frac{126 - 64}{3} = \frac{62}{3} \approx 20.667$. Recalling the fringe demand $Q_f = 2P-20$, we can see that $Q_f = \frac{124}{3} - \frac{60}{3} = \frac{64}{3} \approx 21.333$. Fringe market share is $\frac{64}{3} / \frac{64 + 640}{3} = \frac{1}{11}$.

	{\color{red}NOTE: posted solutions technically don't line up with this but I'm pretty sure there's a typo. Waiting on response from prof}

	{\color{blue}\textbf{Solution:} In Cournot, $q_1 = q_2 = \frac{320}{3} \therefore Q_d = \frac{640}{3} \approx 213.333$ setting market price to $P=\frac{62}{3} \approx 20.667$, fringe produces $Q_f = \frac{64}{3} \approx 21.333$ achieving a market share of $\frac{1}{11}$ to the duopoly's market share of $\frac{10}{11}$.}
\end{enumerate}

\item[2.]

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $q_1$ and $q_2$ refer to $X$ and $Y$ as defined in the problem, and $Q$ to represent the combined total produced. We then solve for the quantities produced by maximizing firm 1's profit function (which will give us both quantities via symmetry):
	\begin{align*}
		max_{q_1} \pi_1 &= (280 - 2q_1 - 2q_2 - 40)*q_1 \\
		\frac{\partial\pi_1}{\partial q_1} &= 240 - 4q_1 - 2q_2 = 0 \\
		q_1 &= 60 - \frac{1}{2}q_2 \\
		\therefore q_2 &= 60 - \frac{1}{2}q_1 \\
		\therefore q_1 &= 60 - \frac{1}{2}(60 - \frac{1}{2}q_1) \\
		&= 30 + \frac{1}{4}q_1 \\
		\therefore q_1 &= 40 \\
		\therefore q_2 &= 60 - 40/2 = 40
	\end{align*}

	Solving for $P$ and then profits is simply a matter of plugging in the solved quantities: $P=280 - 2(40+40) = 120, \pi_1 = \pi_2 = (120-40)(40) = 3200$.

	{\color{blue} \textbf{Solution:} In Cournot equilibrium, $q_1 = q_2 = 40, P=120, \pi_1=\pi_2 = 3200$.}

	\item From part (a), we already know firm 2's reaction function $q_2 = 60 - \frac{1}{2}q_2$. Only firm 1's reaction function changes here, and we solve for it as such:
	\begin{align*}
		max_{q_1} \pi_1 &= (280 - 2q_1 - 2(60 - \frac{1}{2}q_2) - 40)*q_1 \\
		&= (120-q_1)(q_1) \\
		\frac{\partial\pi_1}{\partial q_1} &= 120 - 2q_1 = 0 \\
		\therefore q_1 &= 60 \\
		\therefore q_2 &= 60 - 60/2 = 30
	\end{align*}

	We then use these quantities to solve for $P$ and profits: $P = 280 - 2(60 + 30) = 100, \pi_1 = (100-40)(60) = 3600, \pi_2 = (100-40)(30) = 1800$

	{\color{blue}\textbf{Solution:} In Stackelberg equilibrium with firm 1 choosing first, $q_1 = 60, q_2 = 30, P = 100, \pi_1 = 3600, \pi_2 = 1800$}
